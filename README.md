# Advanced Programming Course Projects - University of Tehran

This repository contains the projects I developed as part of the Advanced Programming course at the University of Tehran. The course focuses on deepening understanding of object-oriented programming, data structures, algorithms, and software engineering principles through a series of challenging coding assignments. Below is an overview of the key projects included in this repository:

## Project 1:
The goal of this exercise is to familiarize with strings and file handling. In this assignment, we will implement a simple diary application that stores daily entries. The program should allow users to view entries for a specific day, as well as display summaries of days that were particularly memorable or eventful.

## Project 2:
This exercise is designed to introduce recursive programming through a set of four distinct problems.

## Project 3:
In this exercise, we will develop a solution for creating an optimized weekly timetable for students, considering multiple constraints related to teacher availability, subject requirements, and student concentration levels. The challenge is to apply a top-down design approach to efficiently schedule classes while adhering to the specified guidelines. 

## Project 4:
The purpose of this exercise is to introduce us to the fundamental concepts of object-oriented design and to apply these principles in software development. In this project, we will design and implement a payroll management system that generates financial reports based on the information available about employees and the teams they work in.

## Project 5:
In this exercise, we will explore event-driven object-oriented programming by developing a game similar to Tetris using the SFML graphical library. This project will provide hands-on experience in integrating programming concepts with graphical elements, allowing us to create an interactive and dynamic game.

## Project 6:
This exercise is designed to familiarize us with the fundamental concepts of polymorphism and how to apply them in software design. Proper class design, inheritance structure, and accurate implementation of functions for each class are critical components of this task.
In this project, we will develop a mission assignment system for drivers in an online ride-hailing platform, similar to services like Snapp. The system will handle predefined missions, with each driver capable of taking on one or more missions. Drivers complete their missions by completing trips, for which they receive rewards. 


## Project 7:
This project serves as a culmination of the concepts and skills we've learned throughout the course. The task is to design and develop a fantasy football website with various features.
This project involves developing the core logic for a competitive fantasy football platform, ensuring that it is fully functional and user-friendly. Users will initially be able to explore various tables, and if they find it interesting, they can create an account to set up their fantasy team. They will then compete with others by earning points.
